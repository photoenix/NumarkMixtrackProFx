## FX select buttons
6 FX buttons act differently than in Serato/VDJ/etc. I don't know how to set a specific effect in Mixxx API, but you can scroll through effect list on both decks. Seems good enough. That leaves two buttons in the middle - they have some bonus functions.
| ~HPF~ deck 1 FX down | ~LPF~ adjust beatgrid    | ~Flanger~ deck 2 FX down |
|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| ~Echo~ deck 1 FX up  | ~Reverb~ quantize toggle | ~Phaser~ deck 2 FX up    |

## Bonus functions
* Shift + browse knob scroll = zoom in/out wave display
* Shift + browse knob press = select item (collapse/extend tree or load track)
* Shift + FX param knob = FX param2
* Shift + load = load track to preview deck
* Shift + sample = stop sample playback
* Shift + play = stutter
* Shift + cue = stop and go to track start

## Fine-tuning
There's a few configurable values at the top of the script, including jogwheel sensitivity and pitch ranges.

## Notes
* Pressing either Shift button will cause both decks to shift. This approach was chosen to be consistent with the behavior of hardware - i.e. pressing either Shift changes midi codes of some controls on both decks.

## Known bugs
* Pressing shift will disable all lights on a deck.
* Fader cuts button's light in active state is a little darker than other buttons. This is because the whole fader cuts function is somehow burned into the hardware, and pressing this button causes some very strange things to happen. If you try setting this button's light to 0x7F, nearby buttons (cue and auto loop) will also get brighter for some reason. If the light is darker, this doesn't happen.
